        <h2>FOREST FIREMAP</h2>
        <p>Since 2024 and 2025, multiple news outlets have reported a rise in wildfires rapidly emerging across California. 
          these wildfires often spark without warning and minutes later, they have fully and sporadically spanned upon whole forests, 
          causing the wildfire to increase in frequency. </p>
        <p>So far there have been frequent incidents of wildfires that have begun sprawling amongst different cities in California, this includes: 
          San Francisco, Casron City, Eureka, Visala, Bakersfield, San Diego, Los Angeles, and Tijuana.</p>  
        <p>Now that these wildfires are more frequent than ever, multiple teams of firefighters are reported in to put it out day and night until the wildfire dies down.
          But even when one wildfire is contained, another is already growing and spreading across making the fires endless. This map shown above provides overview and info of
           wildfire zones and where they are most active. 

        <p>Helping communities stay informed and prepared as the wildfire threat continues to evolve.</p>

      <div class="evacuation-text">
        <h2>EVACUATION MAP</h2>
        <p>With new wildfires on the rise and rapidly spreading from forest to forest, residents within these dangerous hot zones are advised by emergency authorities to evacuate the area as people begin leaving the area to safety.</p>
        <p>Although a majority of the residents safely evacuated the area, there are case where people have been injured or have been killed during these fires. however despite the majority making out alive, some were caught in the fires
          and suffered serious burns and injuries, several being fatalities as a result of the fires.</p>
          <p>From the emergency evacuations that have been announced, These were the numbers recorded from these incidents.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>95–98% of the population within these areas have been evacuated</li>
            <li>1–3% of the population within these areas have been seriously burned due to the delayed evacuations</li>
            <li>Less than 1% of that population was either killed within the fires due to failed emergency response</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>DAMAGES</h2>
        <p>Not only do wildfires cause panic around the area and leave a scorched field in its wake, but they
          leave homes and communities devastated, these widespread impacts include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Property damage: homes, businesses, and infrastructure losses</li>
          <li>Ecological harm: destruction of forests, wildlife habitats, and air quality</li>
          <li>Economic consequences: billions in recovery and firefighting costs</li>
          <li>Long-term effects: soil degradation, water contamination, and climate repercussions</li>

        <div class="causes-text">
          <h2>CAUSES</h2>
          <p>Wildfires can ignite from both natural forces and human activities—though human-caused wildfires account for the overwhelming majority of incidents across the U.S.</p>
          <p>This section highlights the leading causes behind wildfire outbreaks, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Debris burning and open flames</li>
            <li>Equipment and vehicle malfunctions</li>
            <li>Arson and intentional ignition</li>
            <li>Power transmission failures and electrical sparks</li>
            <li>Negligence involving fireworks, smoking, and campfires</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In 2023 alone, over 38% of human-caused wildfires in 
            America were linked to debris and open burning, followed by equipment failures and arson.</p>

        <img src="Wildfire incidents.png" alt="Data from different wildfire incidents" class="content-img" />
        <div class="incidents-text">
          <h2>INCIDENTS</h2>
          <p>The frequency and severity of wildfire incidents in California have escalated over the past decade, with some of the most destructive years recorded in recent history. Data shows that millions of acres are burned annually, with 2020 alone seeing over 3.1 million acres scorched by September.
          Wildfire incidents are not isolated events—they are increasingly driven by a combination of climate change, prolonged droughts, and accumulated fuel loads in forested regions. The graphs above illustrate:</p>
         
          <ul>
            <li>A sharp rise in burned acreage from 2010 to 2020, with multiple years surpassing previous records.</li>
            <li>An increasing correlation between drought severity and wildfire activity. Extended periods of "Extreme" and "Exceptional Drought," especially between 2012 and 2021, have created prime conditions for rapid fire spread.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>These incidents are not only more frequent but also more destructive. The impact spans urban areas and wilderness alike, with entire communities forced to evacuate and ecosystems taking decades to recover.
            Understanding the history and scale of wildfire incidents helps us anticipate future risks, plan emergency responses, and push for more resilient environmental policies.</p>

      <!-- Aftermath -->

        <img src="SF-Orange-Sky.png" alt="Data from different wildfire incidents" class="content-img" />
        <div class="aftermath-text">
          <h2>AFTERMATH</h2>
          <p>The true impact of wildfires often extends far beyond the final flames. Once the smoke clears, communities and ecosystems are left to 
            cope with the long-lasting consequences of fire destruction.</p>
          <h3>Ecological and Environmental Consequences</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Ecosystem Damage: Wildfires can permanently alter landscapes, decimating plant and animal life—even in areas once considered resilient. Recovery may take years, if not decades.</li>
            <li>Soil Erosion: Without vegetation to anchor the soil, burned areas become vulnerable to erosion, mudslides, and flooding, especially during the rainy season.</li>
            <li>Air Pollution: Wildfires release enormous amounts of smoke and particulate matter into the atmosphere, degrading air quality and worsening health conditions across entire regions.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Climate and Atmospheric Changes</h3>
          <p>Wildfire smoke can darken skies hundreds of miles from the blaze, affecting visibility, disrupting solar energy production, and altering weather patterns. Additionally, these fires contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, feeding into the climate cycle that intensifies future fires.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Displacement: Entire towns can be forced to evacuate, and rebuilding efforts may take years—if they happen at all.</li>
            <li>Mental Health Struggles: Survivors often experience trauma, anxiety, and PTSD long after the danger has passed.</li>
            <li>Economic Toll: From emergency response costs to insurance claims and infrastructure repair, wildfire aftermath brings billions in damages.</li>
          </ul>
